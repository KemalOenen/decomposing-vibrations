Welcome to the Nomodeco.py Documentation
========================================

Nomodeco.py is a open-source python package and provides an algorithm for the automatic determination of internal coordinate sets for molecular structures.
Nomodeco can use the results of either `Gaussian`_, `Molpro`_ or `Orca`_ to subsequently find and optimize internal coordinate sets for a given structure.
