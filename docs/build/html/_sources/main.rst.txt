Welcome to the Nomodeco.py documentation!
=========================================

This is the online documentation for the python package Nomoceco.py.

Nomodeco.py enables the automatic determination of an optimal coordinate set for a given molecular structure. Using the atomic coordinates of the given molecule Nomodeco constructs all possible primitive internal coordinates:

* bond stretching
* in-plane angle bending
* linear valance bending
* torsion
* out-of-plane angle bending

The transformation between cartesian and internal coordinates is given by the *Wilson B Matrix*, Nomodeco initializes all possible internal coordinates sets and selects the optimal set based on topolgy and symmetry considerations
