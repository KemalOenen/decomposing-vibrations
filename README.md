# nomodeco.py - a normal mode decomposition tool
A Decomposition scheme for the force constants and frequencies of molecular vibrations, which can be used to quantify the vibrational problem for larger systems. 
Internal coordinate sets are automatically generated and optimized for optimal seperation of the normal modes in terms of internal coordinates.
